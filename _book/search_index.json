[["index.html", "R for Data Science 1 Introduction", " R for Data Science Joshua Mills 1 Introduction Welcome to the intro to R workshop In this book we cover some basic scripting in R, reading data into data frames and some manipulation and graphing of the Data We will be covering it in 3 sessions that are approximately 1:30 hours each. THis workshop is aimed at people who have some experience using programs such as Excel, or have done some basic coding in other languages. Visit the books github page to download the material. THis book has been adapted from the Monash Data Fluency course. As it is aimed at a different audience we will be covering different material here. NOTICE! Thank you for noticing this new notice! Your noticing it has been noted, and will be reported to the authorities!

If a boolean is used for 2.5 Vectors Vectors are used to save a collection of variables, they can be only used to save data of the same type. For example 2.6 Lists Lists are very similar to vectors, but can store any type of data that is available. In a list we can keep strings, booleans, functions and even enire models and dataframes. Indexing a list works much like indexing a string, and can only be used if we 2.7 Loops* 2.8 Conditional Statements* 2.9 Functions* "],["data-frames-and-manipulation.html", "3 Data Frames and manipulation", " 3 Data Frames and manipulation "],["plotting-in-ggplot2.html", "4 Plotting in GGplot2", " 4 Plotting in GGplot2 "]]
